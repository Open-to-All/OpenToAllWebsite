## Authors

- Should each blog post have a unique author (+ link to bio)? Or just one main
AccessMap account?

## About page

- A solid overview of our work with subsections describing the important pieces

## Team page

- If we have per-blog-post authors, should unify with a team page. Team members
should be described with metadata, like yaml + static assets.

## Content + URIs + links

- Adding new, simple static pages should mostly be a matter of editing markdown
in the `content` directory. e.g. adding a page about our `Open Source` work
should require no coding.

- Adding new top-level liks (e.g. to the toolbar) should only require editing
a master list of links - yaml / config file?
